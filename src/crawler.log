They serve as alternatives to original, often more expensive, branded drugs — making treatment more accessible without compromising on safety or efficacy.Generics contain the same active ingredient as the original (reference) product and are produced in the same dosage form to treat the same medical conditions. Before approval, generics must demonstrate bioequivalence, confirming that they act in the same way in the human body as the reference medicine. This ensures they are interchangeable with the originator drug.Generic medicines are launched after the patent of the originator product expires and are held to the same strict regulatory standards as branded drugs. As a result, they match the original products in terms of safety, quality, and effectiveness.Typically offered at significantly lower prices, generics can also benefit from the brand recognition established by the originator company’s previous marketing efforts. This cost advantage translates into substantial savings for national healthcare systems, helping to reallocate funds to more advanced or innovative treatments.In general, generics medicines cost less than originator products. Over time, competition from generics will lead to the decrease of the price of the drug making it affordable for a larger number of patients. Therefore, generics can help increase access to medicines in developed countries struggling to contain rising healthcare costs and in developing countries that are often unable to afford branded medicines. In addition, these savings can make resources available for funding new innovative medicines.",

    "content_text": "Prague/Brussels, 21 May 2025: Zentiva supported Euractiv’s Health Policy Conference in Brussels, where its CEO, Steffen Saltofte, joined senior EU policymakers in the opening panel titled “The EU Pharmaceutical Legislation - Ensuring Fair Access to Medicines for All.”Representing Europe’s off-patent medicine sector, Steffen Saltofte called for a unified approach to reshape pharmaceutical policy with patients at the centre. He emphasised the need to bring together all healthcare stakeholders - from innovators to the off-patent industry, from regulators to policymakers - to fulfil the promise of health as a fundamental right for all. Key topics that Zentiva underlined during the discussion:Equal Access and Timely Competition Are Vital We advocate for pharmaceutical reform that guarantees early patient access through fair competition. Extending exclusivity periods could delay the entry of generics and biosimilars, impacting both affordability and availability.Resilience Starts with Economically Viable EU-Based Manufacturing Our manufacturing sites in Prague and Bucharest maintained continuous supply during recent crises. We call for predictable pricing, investment incentives, and smart procurement rules to secure local production of essential medicines - not just for a few substances, but across the portfolio, ensuring fair access for all who depend on medicines every day.Policy Alignment and Cross-Sector Cooperation Are Essential Industrial, pharmaceutical, and environmental policies must be aligned. Without coordination, new directives - such as the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive - risk undermining medicine supply and innovation in greener technologies.Modern Framework for Sustainable Healthcare Is Needed We support reforms that accelerate the adoption of digital tools, such as digital leaflets, incentivize value-added medicines, and ensure pricing systems reflect real-world costs and sustainability goals.Moderated by EURACTIV’s Anna Gumbau, the discussion featured Rainer Becker, Director for Medical Products and Innovation at DG SANTE in the European Commission; Stine Bosse, Member of the European Parliament and Vice-Chair of the SANT Committee; and Ondřej Knotek, Member of the European Parliament and of the SANT Committee.Platforms like the one provided by Euractiv are vital — they bring us together to listen, collaborate, and drive progress. For the benefit of all people who rely on medicines every day. Because health is a right, not a privilege.",

    "content_text": "Brussels / Prague, May 7, 2025: Health is a right, not a privilege. Zentiva supports the EU vision of leaving no one behind and the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 - Health &amp; Wellbeing, which is strongly linked to other SDGs. As discussions on pharmaceutical legislation reform continue, Zentiva joins the united voice of Europe's off-patent medicines industry to ensure health is at the center of all political decisions. We urge EU Health Ministers to conclude the reform and take steps to secure sustainable healthcare in Europe, protecting the people who depend on affordable medicines every day.This is not just another technical EU policy. It is about ensuring that every European, wherever they live, can access the medicines they need. It’s about avoiding shortages, bringing production back to Europe, and making our health systems more resilient and fair. It is also about making the industry robust for the future, recognising investments in sustainability like reducing carbon emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy at our manufacturing sites.Zentiva is pleased that the off-patent medicines sector, represented by Medicines for Europe, had the opportunity to exchange views with European Health Commissioner Olivér Várhelyi during a recent meeting. We call on EU decision-makers to translate these discussions into actions that strengthen access, affordability, and European production of essential medicines. It’s time for Europe to take responsibility, finalize the pharmaceutical reform, and safeguard patients. Zentiva is calling on decision-makers to:Act as a single market with harmonized principles to ensure faster access to medicines, reduce duplication in regulatory processes, and enable equal treatment for patients across the EU.Support affordable treatment by boosting competition on Day 1 once patents or regulatory exclusivity expire. Harmonization and clarification of the Bolar exemption are critical to achieving this.Prevent medicine shortages with better EU coordination and digital tools.Encourage smarter and affordable innovation on off-patent medicines that can change lives and address major health and environmental issues.Empower the Critical Medicines Act and broaden the principles to the whole sector, as people rely on access to other molecules beyond those defined as “critical” to sustain their health and wellbeing.Address and repair the disproportionate environmental legislation of Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD).With 70% of prescription medicines being generics, 9 out of 10 critical medicines, and 40% of products having no therapeutic alternative other than generic medicines (IQVIA, 2024), it is essential to secure access and production for affordable medicines in Europe. There is no reason to delay reforms that serve Europeans who depend on our medicines every day.",

However, their availability and supply stability face increasing challenges. The European Union&rsquo;s list of critically important medicines includes more than 270 active substances, with 90% being generics&mdash;a cornerstone of accessible healthcare.\nThe Critical Medicines Act introduces strategic investments, improved stockpiling measures, and optimized procurement regulations, laying the groundwork for a more resilient and sustainable supply chain.\nWhile this represents a significant milestone, it is imperative that we advance further. Concentrating only on today&rsquo;s critical medicines is insufficient, as millions of individuals rely on a broader range of medicines daily.\nTo establish a truly resilient system, it is crucial to: \n\n    Invest in European-based medicine production to reduce supply risks \n    Reform procurement rules to prioritize reliability and sustainability, not just the lowest price \n    Ensure financial and regulatory support for off-patent manufacturers of medicines \n    Strengthen supply chain resilience beyond the currently listed critical medicines\n\nZentiva is dedicated to collaborating with all stakeholders to realize this vision. It is imperative that we ensure continued access to essential medicines for the people of Europe. Decisive action is required today to ensure a sustainable future for all generations.",

    "content_text": "Prague, March 10th, 2025: Zentiva has filed a legal case with the Court of Justice of the European Union challenging the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) to safeguard access to affordable medicines in Europe. The implementation of the Directive will lead to medicine shortages, leaving people behind who depend on those products every day.In late 2024, the European Union adopted a significant update to the UWWTD. This revision aims to align the Directive with the Green Deal, addressing contemporary issues such as micropollutants and introducing the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme. The Directive enforces the polluter pays principle, specifically requiring the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries to finance the new quaternary treatment processes at urban wastewater treatment plants to remove these micropollutants. 16 out of 27 Member States of the European Union raised concerns about the Directive’s impact on medicines. Zentiva is challenging the funding mechanism under the Directive, which imposes an unsustainable financial burden on the pharmaceutical industry, threatening the economic viability of needed medicines. Generics account for 70% of all medicines sold in Europe, representing only 19% of the market value, thus making a significant contribution to public health. The role of generics is to expand access to healthcare and secure health outcomes, while helping healthcare decision-makers finance sustainable healthcare.",

    "content_text": "Brussels/Prague, April 25, 2024 &ndash; Zentiva, a Pan-European pharmaceutical company, joined the inaugural launch of the EU&rsquo;s Critical Medicines Alliance, held on April 24-25 in Brussels. This significant event, organized by DG HERA and the Belgian Presidency, convened leaders from across the healthcare industry to address the challenges of medicine supply resilience in the European Union.\n\nZentiva&rsquo;s CEO, Steffen Saltofte, and representatives from the pharmaceutical industry and Medicines for Europe, the Generics association, engaged with EU Health Ministers and discussed actionable strategies to enhance the availability and accessibility of critical medicines throughout Europe.\n\nSteffen Saltofte: \"Our participation in the Alliance underscores our commitment. Together, we need to ensure that essential medicines are accessible to all people who depend on them. As generic medicines represent 70% of treatment volume in Europe and constitute 9 out of 10 products on the critical medicines list, our role is crucial in maintaining the continuity of healthcare services across the continent.\"\n\nDG HERA presented a Vulnerability Assessment performed on a tranche of 11 chosen critical medicines, selected from a broader list of over 200 critical medicines. Zentiva has seriously engaged in this assessment and believes it will be instrumental in addressing future medicine shortages. The discussion highlighted the need for increased manufacturing resilience.\n\nSteffen Saltofte: \"We believe that this assessment and our diligent efforts will lead to comprehensive solutions for shortages, support the European production of medicines, and ensure that the focus remains on substantive outcomes rather than merely increasing administrative burdens and regulations.\"\n\nDiscussions also covered strategies for preventing medicine shortages, enhancing EU manufacturing competitiveness, and ensuring equitable access across member states.\n\nZentiva shared insights from its extensive experience in producing high-quality and affordable medicines at its manufacturing sites in the Czech Republic and in Romania that are marketed in more than 30 countries. The team of 5.000 people is devoted to supporting the EU&rsquo;s vision of building a robust and sustainable healthcare system, that ensures high-quality, accessible pharmaceutical solutions to all people who depend on them.  \nAbout Zentiva\n\nZentiva is a Pan-European Company developing, manufacturing and providing high-quality and affordable medicines to more than 100 million people in Europe.

    "content_text": "Steffen Saltofte, CEO of Zentiva, told TIME that whatever the future holds, Zentiva has been an active leader in the pharmaceutical sector for 500 years, and it will carry on for at least the next 500.\nZENTIVA -Accessible Medicines\nThe annual revenue generated by the Czech Republic's pharmaceutical industry accounts for 4% of the country's total GDP, making its contribution to the national purse proportionately larger than in any of its European counterparts except Poland. It is also a regular and growing magnet for foreign investment\nZentiva is a prime example of the sector&rsquo;s ability to attract foreign direct investment, and the company has become something of an ambassador for both the industry and the country. &ldquo;A great platform full of talented people who we can invest behind to build a new, independent European generics leader,&rdquo; is how U.S. private equity investor Advent International described Zentiva in 2018, after finalizing the company&rsquo;s $2 billion acquisition from another multinational, France&rsquo;s Sanofi.\n \nHow right that description has proved to be. Since changing hands, Zentiva has doubled in size and currently operates in more than 30 countries through a network of 32 subsidiaries and 6 branches, By the end of 2022 it had finalized its expansion into the Netherlands and started operations in Austria.\n&ldquo;We are a European-based company and focus our activities there for the foreseeable future. We are here to provide health and wellbeing for all generations,\" says Zentiva CEO Steffen Saltofte, who was appointed to the role last year and brings with him a wealth of strategic and operational experience from a long and illustrious career at several large multinationals and fast-growing companies.\n \n&ldquo;We reacted to COVID by looking to source our raw materials more locally and moving our production facilities closer to home. Now we look forward to deepening our presence in the region, especially within Central Europe.\" \n \nZentiva's Central European pedigree is beyond question, with the company dating its involvement in the pharmaceutical industry back to the 15th century and the Black Eagle pharmacy, which is still open for business in Prague's Old Town. These roots are, however, just one of the qualities that caught Advent International's eye (and earlier that of Sanofi) and which Saltofte intends to harness to drive the company forward.\n \nZentiva's core strength lies in its commitment to providing high-quality generic medications.\nWith its portfolio, the company contributes to sustainable public health in Europe. These \"off-patent\" drugs offer the same therapeutic benefits as brand-name counterparts, but at a significantly lower cost. This translates to increased access for patients who might otherwise struggle to afford their medications. By focusing on a broad portfolio of essential medicines, Zentiva helps ensure individuals receive the treatment they need, regardless of their financial situation.\n \nWhile a big portion of Zentiva's portfolio is in the off-patent sector, the team's focus on research follows the Czech tradition of searching for innovative solutions. The teams at its R&amp;D centers in Prague and Ankleshwar in India actively manage the life cycle of its products and bring value for the people who depend on the medicines every day. Zentiva drives innovation in drug product formulation and brings bioequivalent medicines to European regulators for review and approval.\nThe company also provides pharmacovigilance and regulatory consulting services to partners via Prague Scientific.\n \nSince 2022, Value-Added Medicines have become the focus. These are the new generation of customized drugs that help address unmet patient needs by moving from a one-size-fits-all approach to a much more tailored and patient specific one. Two years ago, Zentiva took its first public step into this world with the launch of the drug Dasatinib, which is registered in the UK and EU and is a life-saving oncology treatment for people with chronic myeloid and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In the same year, Zentiva also launched 152 molecules and combinations of well-established treatments, all designed to provide more patients with affordable access to high-quality medicines.\n \nSuccessful R&amp;D is only half the battle, with production, logistics, marketing, and sales equally important. \"It can take up to 7 to 10 years to get a concept to market, and we have about 200 people working in R&amp;D,\" says Saltofte. \"But around another 2,500 staff work in our Product Supply division, and it is their job to ensure the drugs get produced and delivered.\" They in turn are supported by a network of 1,900 account handlers and medical representatives who are in regular contact with physicians, pharmacists, and healthcare decision-makers in each of its markets. The loyalty and dedication Zentiva inspires across disciplines has earned it Top Employer awards in Bulgaria and Romania, as well as at home in the Czech Republic.\n \nThe pandemic compelled Zentiva to shorten its supply chain, but it also prompted the company to accelerate its digitalization process.\n \n\"I think COVID forced us to use different sources of communications and to continue to accelerate the way we communicate with each other,\" says Saltofte. \"In time, this will help us speed up some of our processes. Whatever the future holds, we've been active leaders in this sector for 500 years, and we will carry on for at least the next 500.\"\n \nLink to original article by TIME\n\nTo open the interview from TIME as a file, click HERE",

That is why it is one of the focus areas of Zentiva&rsquo;s strategy on waste management, based on our Reduce &ndash; Recycle &ndash; Prevent approach.\nWith a comprehensive waste management plan we are proud that in 2022 we have achieved a reduction of 12% of waste per Standard Manufacturing Unit (from 7,6 g in 2021 to 6,7 g).

Our Sustainability motto is &ldquo;Acting today for a sustainable tomorrow&rdquo; and we are sure that each of us can make a difference and be a #RecyclingHero by following basic rules in our professional and private lives. It is about proper waste sorting, using reusable refill cups and bottles, using cloth bags, avoiding disposable food and drink containers, trying to avoid buying non-recyclable materials that can&rsquo;t be separated &ndash; every small action counts!\nThe vision of Zero waste can be achievable - with the right mindset, expertise, education and processes.

    "content_text": "At Zentiva, offering high-quality, affordable generics to deliver vital drugs is what drives us. Patients are at the heart of everything we do.\nThey should be able to enjoy their life to the fullest. That is why we follow the needs in the most-needed therapeutic areas very closely to cater to the needs of the majority.\nWe are focusing on bringing medicines for patients with cardiovascular, respiratory, urogenital system conditions, and oncology where we also develop our own value-added medicines. \n\nBecause in everyday life minor ailments happen, Zentiva also focuses on selfcare for people to get efficient, affordable fast-relief OTC products at the pharmacy.\nRead our CEO&rsquo;s, Nick Haggar, interview with the CEO Magazine on how the company is committed to answering these unmet patients&rsquo; needs.\n\nNick Haggar&rsquo;s father suffered from a heart condition that required him to take medication for his entire life. As a child, Nick saw how the disease made simple things difficult or impossible for his dad, and this inspired him to pursue a career where he could help people with similar issues. \n&ldquo;My father didn&rsquo;t enjoy a normal life,&rdquo; Nick says. &ldquo;At times, he was quite restricted in what he could do. So I wanted to be part of something that would be helpful &ndash; helpful to him and helpful to people like him.&rdquo;\n\nSo, at the age of 21, Nick entered the healthcare industry. Today he is CEO of Zentiva, a Prague-based pharmaceutical company that specialises in off-patent medicines and serves around 100 million people a year across 50 countries. The firm employs around 4,700 people, with four manufacturing sites in Prague, Bucharest and Ankleshwar, and also has a physical presence in 30 countries.  \n&ldquo;My purpose is to try to help as many people as possible have access to high-quality, affordable medicines, to live better lives and to live life to the full,&rdquo; Nick says. &ldquo;That motivates me every day.&rdquo;\n\nZentiva&rsquo;s role in the pharmaceuticals market is to offer lower cost drugs to a wider section of the market once the drugs&rsquo; patents have expired. While the company does not have its own drug discovery, it innovates to improve the patient experience &ndash; for example, by developing new combinations of drugs to better manage symptoms or offering a new way to deliver a drug. \n\n&ldquo;Companies like Zentiva enter the market and bring competition with our own bio-equivalent medicine,&rdquo; Nick explains. &ldquo;At that moment, the pricing of the medicine comes down and the number of patients receiving access to that gold-standard medicine goes up. Healthcare budgets don&rsquo;t increase, in fact these medicines can come in under budget, allowing the difference to be reinvested.&rdquo; \n\nZentiva&rsquo;s offerings in high-volume generic medicines are focused on several therapeutic areas, including cardiology &ndash; the branch of medicine so important to Nick&rsquo;s father &ndash; diabetes, respiratory conditions, oncology and cancer care, over-the-counter self-care medications and urology.\n\n\nOffering lower-cost generics and expanding the market in vital drugs is a model that Nick finds extremely motivating; the better Zentiva does as a business, the more people stand to benefit. \n&ldquo;As Zentiva grows, more patients get the medicines they need,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Every single year, as Zentiva grows, we reduce the cost of medicines across Europe. I love that. It&rsquo;s a great passion of mine. It drives me and we work hard as a company to connect everybody to that purpose.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also a bit of a guiding light because it helps you make good decisions,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It helps you keep a balanced view. We are here to grow the company and perform financially, but we have an incredible role to play in public health and in society. We have to make sure that we achieve both those objectives.&rdquo;\nDOUBLING SALES\n\n\nShortly after Nick became Zentiva&rsquo;s CEO in early 2019, the company set out on an ambitious plan to double the size of the business, from &euro;700 million to &euro;1.4 billion in sales, within five years.\n\n\n&ldquo;As of the end of 2021, we&rsquo;re about a &euro;1.2 billion sales company, so we&rsquo;re well on track to doubling the company in five years,&rdquo; Nick says. That growth has been achieved thanks to an insatiable desire among his team to seek out and deliver to underserved markets, which has been made possible thanks to the backing of Zentiva&rsquo;s private equity parent company, Advent International.\n\n\n&ldquo;Everyone in our company can put their fingerprints on differences that we are making every day, whether that&rsquo;s new combinations of medicines, better ways of helping patients or being able to respond when a country or a customer has no supply, and Zentiva is able to fill the gap and make sure there&rsquo;s a continuous flow of medicines,&rdquo; Nick says.\n&ldquo;I love the team that I&rsquo;m with because we are doing so much good, but there is so much opportunity to do more. Being a fast-growing company with a private equity backer, we have the ability to invest in our teams, invest in our technology, invest in our manufacturing sites and invest in helping patients,&rdquo; he adds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as being a way to reach more patients, growth is what Nick calls &ldquo;the magic ingredient&rdquo; &ndash; it helps demonstrate to everyone within the company, and all the stakeholders outside of it, that the formula is working and that being on board with Zentiva is worthwhile.\n&ldquo;All partners involved in this see the benefit &ndash; patients get benefits, payers get benefits, the company grows, there&rsquo;s more opportunity in the company,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting. It&rsquo;s a dynamic environment and really supported by this growth mindset. It gets me going each day because every day there&rsquo;s something new, something more we can do, and it just keeps coming.&rdquo;\nTHE CORE FRAMEWORK\nWhile his inspiration for entering the industry comes from his father, the framework that Nick uses to guide him as a leader comes from his wife, Jacqui, who is, quite conveniently, an executive coach.\n\n\n&ldquo;She came up with a model a long time ago called CORE: courage, openness, resilience and energy. It&rsquo;s a framework that I keep going back to, whether I&rsquo;m confronted with a new situation or I&rsquo;m thinking about the business, but it also plays extremely well when your path ahead is uncertain,&rdquo; Nick says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CORE framework gives Nick a calm confidence in the face of challenges, he says, and helps him to maintain empathy towards those around him when things don&rsquo;t go the way he wants them to.\n \n&ldquo;People are suffering around you in different ways,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re uncertain. In some cases, they&rsquo;re lost. Some of your business partners don&rsquo;t know where they&rsquo;re going, and that ability to empathise and connect and to show resilience, to really show the caring dimension, makes all the difference.&rdquo;\n\n\nNick always tries to bear in mind, whoever he&rsquo;s dealing with, that &ldquo;everybody is challenged, not just purely professionally but in a rather unique way, a profound way, privately and personally as well as professionally&rdquo;.\n\n\n\n\nHis empathetic approach is not just an individual leadership strategy; it also feeds into the fundamental values of the company, which prizes ethics and responsibility throughout its hierarchy and among its external partners.\n \nIt has been particularly valuable to have such values in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nick says. &ldquo;I think in these moments, it reminds you how powerful it is to have a good centre, to be building a healthy company that you&rsquo;re proud of, because there are certain things that carry you through. One of those things in our company is our sense of responsibility, that we have to put other things aside and focus on what&rsquo;s going to make the biggest difference to the most people.&rdquo;\n\n\nWith any decision the company makes, Nick and his team always try to look ahead 10 years to imagine how that decision will be judged in the future, he says.\n\n\n&ldquo;Did we as a leadership team, as a company, do everything we could?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Did we imagine the possibilities and did we really try to do the maximum? With that kind of future standard looking back at you, I think that encourages you and gives you the courage to do more and the energy to do more.&rdquo; \nMIXING MEDS\nThe key areas where Zentiva is focusing its innovative efforts at the moment are cardiology and oncology. Despite the prevalence of numerous cancer and heart disease drugs, the company still sees many unmet needs. That does not mean Zentiva&rsquo;s researchers are on the hunt for new types of drugs, but rather new ways of combining existing drugs and new ways of delivering them.\n\n\n&ldquo;We are looking at new, unique and innovative combinations of medicines to help patients manage their symptoms better, what we call value-added medicines,&rdquo; Nick says. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;re looking at the medicine from the patient point of view and making it more flexible for the patient &ndash; easier for the patient to take and to tolerate.&rdquo;\n\n\nZentiva also uses its expertise to make work easier for medical professionals as well, for example, by making it easier for nurses to deliver certain drugs. The company keeps a close eye on emerging technologies and works to incorporate them into its offerings. \n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re deploying and exploring how to make existing medication work even better. For example, we&rsquo;re exploring nanotechnology films, rapid dissolving films and new technology platforms that are only just now coming into the mainstream,&rdquo; Nick says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2030, sustainability is another core priority. Zentiva&rsquo;s European manufacturing sites already run on 100 per cent renewable energy and, in the last year alone, strides have been taken to reduce water consumption (its Bucharest site decreased overall water usage by 35 per cent in the last year). The company has also planted over 40,000 trees.\n\nNick also explains that its research and development team is looking at ways to reduce the impact of its drugs on the environment as well. When someone takes medication, a large amount of it passes through their body and ends up in the water supply. So Zentiva is working on delivery systems that ensure the medicine stays in the patient. Sometimes, this means giving a lower dose that is taken up more efficiently by the body.\n\n\n&ldquo;That innovation stream looks pretty promising,&rdquo; Nick says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a complex path, for sure, but we believe if you look at the future standard, this is the work that should be done.&rdquo;\n\n\n\n\nFinding the answer to such problems may not be the easiest task for Zentiva, but Nick didn&rsquo;t join the industry for easy wins. He did it to make a difference.\n\nRead the original interview\n\n\n    .grid_article {display:grid;grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;gap: 30px;}\n    p {font-size: 18px;line-height: 28px;}\n",

Ing. Marian Piecha, Ph.D. LLM and Eduard Muřick&yacute;. \nThey discussed many topics with them and during the meeting, Zentiva was presented as a major domestic pharmaceutical manufacturer and as a company focused on research and development in the field of value-added medicines. Furthermore, the discussion evolved around our contributions to the Czech economy, its sustainability, and responses to the energy and inflation crisis.\n\"Recent years have shown us how important a strong domestic pharmaceutical production is for the continuous supply of medicines to Czech citizens, whose health often depends on them. We are clearly aware of this importance and we have proven our ability to ensure the supply of medicines under all circumstances, especially in the last two pandemic years. It is this awareness that drives us forward in Zentiva. Currently, we deliver almost every fifth prescribed box of medicines to the Czech market,\" says Soňa Porubsk&aacute;, Head of Corporate Affairs.\nIt was an honour to have them at our offices and discuss the Czech Pharmaceutical Industry. It has become an important topic especially due to the ongoing Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the constant challenges it has faced over recent years such as the energy crisis.  \n\nDeputy Minister Doc. Ing. Marian Piecha, Ph.D. LLM underlined: \"The pharmaceutical industry is a strategic sector with high added value. We are very pleased that Zentiva is further developing its capacities for the production of pharmaceuticals in the Czech Republic, investing in research and development of value-added medicines, and fulfilling important EU documents &ndash; industrial and pharmaceutical strategy. The EU's self-sufficiency in key industrial sectors is currently our priority. \"\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    @media only screen and (min-width: 720px) {\n    .grid_article {display:grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;gap:20px;}}\n",

    "content_text": "PRAGUE &ndash; September 16, 2022 &ndash; Between 7th and 9th September, the fourth ORBIS School was held in Prague. The event was co-hosted by Zentiva in close collaboration with the German company Physiolution and the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague. Many various lectures and workshops were held during these three days and the participants had a great opportunity to share their experiences and knowledge based on their own research. Part of the program was a visit to Zentiva&rsquo;s R&amp;D department in its Prague site.\nORBIS (Open Research Biopharmaceutical Internships Support) is an international project which is a part of the EU program HORIZON 2020, focused on research and development. ORBIS is a platform that unites universities, research institutes, and pharmaceutical companies from several European countries.\nSUPPORTING AN INTERNATIONAL NETWORK TO ENHANCE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \nParticipants from Ireland, France, Finland, Germany, Poland and Ukraine came to Prague for the ORBIS School. Lectures and workshops at the University of Chemistry and Technology and the Czech Technical University were focused on biopharmaceutical principles and novel techniques or modern bioanalytical methods. The goal of the ORBIS project is to strengthen the connection between academic and industry fields, exchange expert knowledge and create international partnerships across Europe, which can move pharmaceutical research ahead. &ldquo;Innovations are a crucial part of what we do. At Zentiva, almost 200 employees work in the R&amp;D department. We support young talents and work on strengthening the academia-pharma industry cooperation. Joining the ORBIS project was an ideal opportunity to develop this type of cooperation on an international level. We believe that this kind of partnership is the key to success,&rdquo; says Pavel &Scaron;ebek, Development Director of Zentiva. &ldquo;Meeting other experts with different backgrounds is very enriching. It is always interesting to hear about the experience of others and discover new original approaches to R&amp;D. These events are always a great motivation,&rdquo; says Nikita Marinko, a young and talented scientist from Zentiva who took part at this year&rsquo;s ORBIS School and was part of the organizational team that took care of all the participants.\nOut of all four ORBIS schools which have been held so far, two of them &ndash; the second one and this one (the fourth one) &ndash; have been co-organized by Zentiva. In September 2019, in collaboration with the University of Helsinki, Zentiva organized the school covering the design of pharmaceutical dosage forms and the manufacturing processes, whereas novel bio-relevant analytical approaches used in the characterization of dosage forms have been covered this September in Prague. Both schools were particularly based on academic findings combined with real-life examples, such applied scientific approaches being appreciated by all participants.\n\n\nThe high number of attendees confirmed the strength of the ORBIS scientific network and focus on innovative approaches to meet currently unmet patient needs.\n\nAbout ORBIS &ndash; Open Research Biopharmaceutical Internships Support (Maria Skłodowska-Curie Actions of Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020-MSCA-RISE-2017)\n\nThe overarching objective of ORBIS is to form an international and inter-sectoral academic and industrial network. The action is aimed at improving the preclinical pathway of medicine development concentrating on processes and technologies. The goal is to integrate multidisciplinary research by involving the academia and the industry from EU (Poland, Ireland, Finland, Germany, and the Czech Republic), EU associated countries (Ukraine) and US. The coordinator of the project is Prof. Janina Lulek from Poznan University of Medical Sciences (Poland).

    "content_text": "With a global reach that extends to more than 30 countries, Zentiva is a fast-growing pharmaceutical company. To keep delivering high-quality, affordable medicines and make them accessible to even more people, it needed a platform that could keep up with its continuous growth. So, the company decided to consolidate everything into the cloud. By deploying SAP on Azure, a large-scale project realized by the technology partner Atos, Zentiva now boasts a scalable and cost-effective enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform that offers unmatched agility and resilience.\n&ldquo;We now have a future-ready and flexible IT environment to help us optimize, scale and expand our footprint.&rdquo; Josef Matousek, Head of IS Zentiva\nHeadquartered in Prague and with manufacturing sites and R&amp;D centers spread across the globe, Zentiva employs more than 4,500 people. Yet, its fragmented, on-premises IT environment began to drain company time and resources, putting a wrench in its ambitious growth prospects and, more importantly, jeopardizing its mission to deliver high-quality, affordable branded generics and over-the-counter products.\n\n\"We needed a scalable, multi-country solution covering processes in areas spanning from production planning to finance and controlling,&rdquo; explains Josef Matousek, Head of IS at Zentiva. &ldquo;As Microsoft has been a strategic partner of Zentiva for over two decades, and they&rsquo;ve given us our cloud-first approach, Azure was naturally our number one choice for our SAP deployment,&rdquo; he adds. \n&ldquo;There are many design options when building an SAP S/4HANA environment in Azure, so we also needed experts who have knowledge of both Azure and SAP. Atos&rsquo; expertise proved critical in implementing SAP S/4HANA on Azure, providing innovative ideas and clear guidance on designing the solution that would best fit us,&rdquo; says Matousek.\nBringing down complexity and beefing up security \n&ldquo;Today, our SAP cluster solution is all within a single Azure region connected through a low-latency network. This helped us reduce complexity and optimize costs, as we can easily monitor and adjust our consumption to our needs and at any time through a pay-as-you-go model,&rdquo; explains Matousek. \nThe company&rsquo;s data privacy needs were addressed through Microsoft&rsquo;s comprehensive set of compliance offerings and strengthened with Azure Security Center. Zentiva also keeps track of its IT environment apps performance using Azure Monitor.  &ldquo;Thanks to a single sign-on with multi-factor authentication through Azure Active Directory, we&rsquo;ve also facilitated access for our IT officers while dramatically improving our security,&rdquo; highlights Matousek.\nA future-proof, partner-friendly technology\nWithin Azure, Zentiva enjoys access to innovative solutions such as big data capabilities and IoT platforms, enabling it to keep pace with the latest technological progress. &ldquo;All these new technologies are rolled out in a very short time which is crucial for us. We need to accelerate the pace, so do our supporting processes. We now have a future-ready and flexible IT environment to help us optimize, scale, and expand our footprint,&rdquo; Matousek enthuses.\nZentiva is poised for a new era of innovation. &ldquo;SAP S/4HANA on Azure offered us the ERP capabilities we wanted with the security, availability and resiliency we needed to develop our business, but it&rsquo;s also given us the speed and confidence to embrace the future with excitement,&rdquo; Matousek concludes.\n ",

    "content_text": "PRAGUE - February 26, 2021 - The Centre for Applied Pharmaceutical Research (The Parc), which was founded by Zentiva in cooperation with leading Czech academic institutions, is celebrating numerous successes again, summarizing its 2020 achievements and recognizing the participants with The Parc Awards for the third time\nIn 2020 The Parc continued its mission to provide young talented researchers with a world-class education and collaboration with professionals working to accelerate drug innovation and research. The international platform welcomed 11 new students into the program extending the number of participants to record 38 doctoral students. The participants achieved impressive results last year, including the completion of 12 professional publications and receiving a prestigious InPharma grant &ndash; an EU-funded MSCA (Marie Sklodowska Curie Actions) European Industrial Doctorate programme. Three students finalized their studies and one founded a technological start-up. The Parc also extended in 2020 the network of collaborating universities in Europe.\n&ldquo;Our achievements rocked science in 2020. I am proud of every student in The Parc and I would like to thank all the supervisors from Zentiva and the academia for the student&rsquo;s supervision and enthusiasm to solve current challenges in pharmaceutical science together. The Parc&acute;s research clearly addresses the key challenges the pharma industry is facing today and its results are directly applied in the new products development and manufacturing&rdquo; &ndash; said Ondrej Dammer, The Parc&rsquo;s Operational Director.\nFor the third time, The Parc doctoral students were awarded The Parc Awards in two categories. Tereza Boleslavsk&aacute; won The Student Choice Award for her project on &ldquo;Development of biorelevant in vitro dissolution method&rdquo; while the second Student award went to Jan Jir&aacute;t for &ldquo;Crystal design and crystallization process development&rdquo; and the third Student prize was awarded to Jakub Petř&iacute;k for his work on &ldquo;Forced degradation study system development&rdquo;. The Expert Choice Award went to Jiř&iacute; Kol&aacute;ř for his work &ldquo;Mathematical modeling of unit operations in pharmaceutical formulation processes&rdquo;. \nProf. Franti&scaron;ek &Scaron;těp&aacute;nek, The Parc&rsquo;s Scientific Director commented: &ldquo;I would like to congratulate the winners and all the students for their 2020 research studies and results. At The Parc we continue to provide a bridge between excellent basic research in pharmaceutical sciences and its translation to real pharmaceutical products that can be clinically tested, registered, and manufactured. Through collaboration with the best academic institutions across the EU our platform provides its Ph.D. students with the opportunity to gain first-hand experience of both academic and industrial R&amp;D environment, thus broadening their future career prospects. It is great to acknowledge that The Parc alumni launch successful careers not only in the pharmaceutical industry and academic institutions across Europe, but this year also the first technological start-up company was founded by one of our graduates.&rdquo;\nZentiva strongly believes that supporting students by bridging the gap between theoretical science and what happens in the real-life in pharma will have a valuable impact on the future careers of young people, especially members of the Z generation in the Czech Republic. The high quality of the students&rsquo;  program and its practical benefits were also recognized by Prime Minister Andrej Babi&scaron; during his visit to The Parc last September.\n&ldquo;From the superb quality of research receiving this year&acute;s awards, it is clearly visible that the Parc is already fulfilling its mission to build a strong foundation for further growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the Czech Republic.  The unique combination of world-class academic education with practical hands-on industrial and business experience in The Parc clearly shows a functional and successful example of how to speed up the transfer of academic research into practical applications in the industry, boost the research and development activities in the companies and prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers to be ready at their graduation to tackle the industrial challenges of the future. The Parc shows one of the ways we can really deliver on the &ldquo;country for future&rdquo; strategy of the Czech Republic&rdquo; - summarized Pavel Sebek, Zentiva's Development Director and one of the founders of The Parc.\nAbout The Parc\nInitiated by Zentiva, The Parc was created in association with three academic partners: the University of Chemistry and Technology Prague; the Faculty of Science of Charles University; and the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences. This highly successful initiative has brought rising talent together with leading pharmaceutical and academic experts, all working to accelerate innovation in drug research &amp; development.\nThe Parc provides world-class academic education combined with practical hands-on industrial and business experience under the leadership of scientists, engineers, and managers both from academia and the pharmaceutical industry. It enables students to gain graduate-level training in pharmaceutical sciences bridging chemistry, pharmaceutical technology, bio pharmacy, and clinical research. Results of the students&rsquo; research are frequently directly implemented in real-world products launched to the market to help patients. Collaborating with academic partners across Europe, The Parc also offers secondments for students and research experience exchanges supervised by top academic scientists.\nMore information about The Parc can be found on www.theparc.eu.\nAbout Zentiva\nZentiva is a producer of high-quality affordable medicines serving patients in Europe and beyond.

    "content_text": "PRAGUE &ndash; March 24, 2021: On the occasion of the International Day of Forests, Zentiva  approved the planting of 27,800 trees: 20,000 to be planted in Romania in April, and 7,800 in Madagascar. This new step is part of the PlanetZ program which aims to make a continuous and positive contribution to our environment. Zentiva is partnering with the NGOs Planet Urgence and Carpathia Conservation Foundation. The trees are planted in Itasy and Analamanga regions (Madagascar) and Făgăraș Mountains (Romania).\n\nIn addition to reducing carbon footprint, these two initiatives will also provide additional sources of income for local communities. In Madagascar, recovering wild silk trees protects biodiversity and enhances the local economy. In Romania, the project that is restoring the areas affected by deforestation is carried out with employees from neighboring localities. \n\nNick Haggar, Chief Executive Officer Zentiva commented: &ldquo;The Zentiva team of 4,500 associates is very engaged with our PlanetZ sustainability program. Our ambition is to plant 150,000 trees as part of our carbon-neutral program. We all share this beautiful planet and we all have the responsibility to take care of it. Zentiva has already switched its European manufacturing operations to renewable energy one year ago, and we continue to work on a wide range of environment, social care and governance projects.&rdquo;\n\nThe initiatives build on previous Zentiva PlanetZ collaborations in Romania with Forests Without Frontiers which saw 7,000 trees planted in 2019 and April 2020, and in Portugal with ANEFA which saw 4,500 trees planted.\n\n\nAbout Zentiva\nZentiva is a producer of high-quality affordable medicines serving patients in Europe and beyond.

    "content_text": "Prague - March 31, 2021 &ndash; Zentiva passed over 250,000 packs of its Sanicor disinfectant to Czech Food banks for a symbolic price. Food banks will further distribute the Sanicor disinfectant to people in need and vulnerable groups, such as shelters, single mothers, and outreach clients.\nThe idea was supported by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.\n\n\"Zentiva approached us with a request for recommendations on where to meaningfully direct its offer. We have been cooperating with Food banks for a long time and their support is more than appropriate in the current situation. Therefore, we decided to recommend this organization. The Food bank can get help to those most in need very quickly through his partners\" concludes Mgr. Martina &Scaron;těp&aacute;nkov&aacute;, MPA, Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Affairs.\n\nSanicor Disinfection will be supplied in two sizes, 50ml and 500ml intended for direct distribution to individuals, and larger packages can then be used in common areas of shelters, contact centers, etc. The symbolic price corresponds to 0.01 CZK smaller package and CZK 0.10 for larger.\n\n\"As part of our #WeHelpOthers Programme Zentiva wanted to help the most endangered groups in the Czech Republic within our capabilities in the current urgent epidemiological situation. Because we want to target where this need is the most urgent, we decided to contact the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs for advice. We are very pleased that the Ministry has directed us, opening the door for further potential cooperation with Food bank, \"comments Soňa Porubsk&aacute;, General Manager of Zentiva CZ&amp;SK.\n\nThe aim is to support all those who do not have access to disinfectants or hygiene products and protective equipment in the current situation. Together with Food banks, we managed to select specific institutions throughout the Czech Republic, through which personal disinfection of Sanicor will reach the most endangered clients. This will help them in their daily protection against viruses and bacteria.\n\n\"The number of people in need is constantly growing, our customer organizations work with them daily and try to help them as much as possible. They often lack the money to satisfy even the most basic human needs. Disinfection or special hygiene is not available for most of them. We appreciate that Zentiva is helping us. We will now get as quickly as possible to those who need it the most,\" adds Mgr. Veronika L&aacute;chov&aacute;, Director of the Czech Federation of Food Banks.\n\nThis activity will be further supported by a private carrier, the company PROfreight CZ, s.r.o., which will ship Sanicor Zentiva disinfection to food banks throughout the Czech Republic pro bono.\nMgr.

    "content_text": "PRAGUE &ndash; January 27, 2020: Zentiva welcomed The Pharmaceutical Applied Research Center (The Parc) to their Prague headquarters to celebrate the first anniversary of The Parc Awards. The Parc is a unique research platform designed to prepare future generations of pharmaceutical scientists and engineers. Twenty-nine students are currently included in the program and an outstanding track record has been achieved in 2019: 16 publications, one patent application, 30 conference presentations, six plenary and keynote lectures, eight research grants and five students finalized their studies.\n&ldquo;2019 was a hugely successful year. I&rsquo;d like to clearly emphasize the energy all our partners bring to the project. We now have 29 PhD students in the program and what is really important is the joint supervision students receive from both scientific/academic and industrial supervisors. This creates a unique combined industrial-academic environment which is the strength of The Parc for 2020 and the future,&rdquo; says Ondrej Dammer, The Parc&rsquo;s Operational Director. \nProf. Franti&scaron;ek &Scaron;těp&aacute;nek, The Parc&rsquo;s Scientific Director added, &ldquo;I feel very proud, especially of the students. I have had the opportunity to see them develop over several years from being young undergraduates joining The Parc to becoming Master&rsquo;s graduates and then joining the PhD program. It is really satisfying to see the progress that they have made, both as individuals, as professionals and, of course, as scientists.&rdquo;\nThis year, The Parc Awards went to two young talents. Denisa Lizonova was awarded the Student Choice Award 2019 for her project on &lsquo;Modified Liposomes for Drug Delivery&rsquo; and Vojtech Klimsa received the Expert Choice Award 2019 for his work on &lsquo;High Throughput Screening of Spray Dried Formulations&rsquo;. Both awards are sponsored by Zentiva.\nPavel Sebek, Zentiva's Development Director and one of the founders of The Parc recalled its history and growth from an idea born 5 years ago: &ldquo;We are so proud of what has been achieved to date. The combination of top-level science training combined with the development of industrial, business and leadership skills is not only unique but recognized across Europe. The future is in the hands of our young and creative cluster of students who have the ambition and skills to be at the top of pharmaceutical science and technology and are energized to make a difference in the pharma world. What makes me especially proud is that some of the students have decided to work for Zentiva after completing The Parc program and have become valuable members of our international development team.&rdquo;\nAbout The Parc\nInitiated by Zentiva, The Parc was created in association with three academic partners: the University of Chemistry and Technology Prague; the Faculty of Science of Charles University; and the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences. This highly successful initiative has brought rising talent together with leading pharmaceutical and academic experts, all working to accelerate innovation in drug research &amp; development.\nThe Parc provides world class academic education combined with practical hands-on industrial and business experience under the leadership of scientists, engineers and managers both from academia and the pharmaceutical industry. It enables students to gain graduate-level training in pharmaceutical sciences bridging chemistry, pharmaceutical technology, biopharmacy and clinical research. Results of the students&rsquo; research are frequently directly implemented in real world products launched to market to help patients. Collaborating with academic partners across Europe, The Parc also offers secondments for students and research experience exchanges supervised by top academic scientists.\nMore information about The Parc can be found on www.theparc.eu. \nAbout Zentiva\nZentiva is a producer of high-quality affordable medicines serving patients in Europe and beyond.

The group within which Zentiva has been involved as an industrial partner, officially named Open Research Biopharmaceutical Internships Support (ORBIS), responded to the call within Horizon 2020 from the European Commission with a proposal to form an international and inter-sectoral academic and industrial network.\nSpecifically, common aim of the group is to improve drug product development pathways integrating multidisciplinary research on processes and technologies by involving academia and industry from EU (Poland, Ireland, Finland, Germany and Czech Republic), EU associated country (Ukraine) and US.\nThe complementary consortium comprises experts in computations, physical chemistry, material science, nanotechnology, pharmacy, pharmacology and bioanalysis. Within 4 years European scientists will merge their expertise in drug synthesis and dissolution, oral formulations, and bioanalytical methods with the knowledge on dermal research provided by the US partner.\nBased on areas where Zentiva aims to further deepen its scientific expertise, closest cooperation will be achieved with the University of Helsinki, Trinity College, PUMS, PRI and Rutgers.\nOur aim is to exchange researchers between us and Universities through so-called &ldquo;secondments&rdquo; which are the type of assignments resulting in few-month research spent within laboratories of the members of the consortium, exchanging knowledge and expertise based on real-life examples faced on a daily basis during drug product development.\nAs a long-term result of such approach, we believe that drug product development process will be shortened, risk of failures will be mitigated and new drug products will be made more accessible and affordable for society.\n&ldquo;Although very exciting, product development also carries high complexity, requiring continuous development of knowledge and scientific understanding, but also preparedness to fail. Translated into business language, it requires time and significant financial support which at the end reflects in the costs of the product. \nWith this program while learning more, we are also faster, and we bring the medicines to the patients sooner. In other words, we are making healthcare more affordable: a right, not a privilege.&rdquo;\nAleksandra Dumicic, Innovation Director, Zentiva.",

Within Speak Up, you may use any means or channel available to you (“Speak Up Channel”) to be heard.Additionally, as a reaction to EU Whistleblower Directive, we have implemented a Whistleblowing mechanism (“Whistleblowing”). As required by the applicable local laws, we created the dedicated communication channels to be used for Whistleblowing (“Whistleblowing Channel”).The Chapter “Reporting of Concerns” in our Code of Ethics lays out the essential rules for both Whistleblowing and Speak Up mechanisms. Whistleblowing and Speak Up are both covered by detailed internal rules in each Zentiva company, and Whistleblowing, in addition, also when subject to applicable local or EU laws.If you want to raise a concern, please make sure you are using the right tool:you can always choose Speak Up, in any country, for any concern, by any channel| ORif your Zentiva entity falls within Whistleblowing scope (EU Whistleblower Directive), you can choose dedicated internal reporting channel(s) for Whistleblowing.Rest assured that there will be no retaliation in both Speak Up and Whistleblowing against good-faith reporting.“Speak Up” or “Whistleblowing”?If you want to raise a concern, please make sure you are using the right tool, the differences are highlighted further down.

Whistleblowing in individual countries Zentiva, k.s. Zentiva International a.s. If you cannot find a particular Zentiva affiliate in the list above, it means that the affiliate is outside the scope of EU whistleblowers’ protection under the Directive (e.g. due to number of employees being below 50).Please note, that whistleblowers’ protection is only granted when the report is made through the internal reporting channel of the respective legal entity. Therefore, please make sure you are using the right reporting channel. In case you make the report to an entity not concerned by the report we can neither investigate nor forward the report to the right entity. In that case, we will not evaluate the report. The confidentiality of your report will not be compromised and we will inform you that the report will not be investigated further.Please NOTE, that THIS IS NOT AN ACCESS TO ZENTIVA SPEAK UP initiative.
